# ICS 32: Programming with Software Libraries
The class is taught by Professor Moshirpour in Spring 2025. I am one of the learning assistants in the class, with my main responsibility being guiding students in assignments and helping them debug their code.

This repository contains code I wrote for the homeworks so I am able to keep track of the assignment requirements as well as refine my own Python skills.
