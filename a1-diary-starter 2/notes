Difference between shlex.split and default split:
- shlex.split(): respects quotes and escape characters
- split(): will just split your string brainlessly unless you specify .split(",") etc
- both will split the contents of the string into elements in a list

About the pathlib module:
- helps handle different paths for different operating systems (like MacOS and Windows)
- from pathlib import Path is sufficient in most cases
p = Path(".")
p.exists(): check if path exists
p.is_file(): check to see if file
p.is_dir(): check to see if directory
p.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
new_path = p / 'subdir' / 'file.txt': joining paths

How to organize modules:
1. notebook.py has helper classes and methods that you should use
2. command_parser.py is where you should write your parsing functions
3. a1.py is your main module where you run stuff

Errors you should catch in your code:
- NotebookFileError: put this where you see fit! It is meant to be in a try-except block
- IncorrectNotebookError: put this where you see fit!
    - Deserializing means converting from a file that we can see into computer bytes

To delete the .json file using "D" command:
- import os (might have to check with TA to see if this is legal)
- os.path.exists(user_entered_path_that_should_be_parsed)
- os.remove(user_entered_path_that_should_be_parsed)
